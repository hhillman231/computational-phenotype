	<p align=center><b>Statement of Informed Consent</b></p>
	<p>
		Please read this consent agreement carefully before deciding whether to participate in this experiment.
	</p></
	<p>
		Purpose of the research:
		To examine the way people make decisions and learn about the relationships between stimuli, actions and rewards.
	</p>

	<p>
What you will do in this research:
Stimuli (images) will be presented on the computer and you will be asked to choose between different actions after which you may receive feedback to earn monetary reward. You may also be asked to fill out short questionnaires.
	</p>
	<p>

		Time required:
		Participation will take between 1 minute and 2 hours to complete.
	</p>
	<p>
		Risks:
		Some of the questionnaires contain questions about sensitive topics such as sexual, physical, or emotional abuse, drug use, violent behavior, medical/psychiatric history, etc., and could cause you to feel uncomfortable or upset. If you do not feel comfortable, you can skip questions or stop the questionnaires at any time.	</p>
	<p>
		Benefits:
		This study provides no benefits to you individually. The study provides important information about the nature of learning and decision making. This has potential implications for public domains, such as healthcare policy and the justice system, where understanding the processes governing choice (e.g., of insurance, medical care, illegal substances) can lead to more psychologically effective public policy.
	</p>
	<p>
		Compensation:
		You will receive payment commensurate with $10/hour via Amazon Mechanical Turk.
	</p>
	<p>
		Confidentiality:
		Your participation in this study will remain confidential. Your MTurk worker IDs will NOT be shared with anyone outside of the research team. However, work you perform on MTurk can be linked to your public profile page. Thus, to maximize your privacy, you may wish to restrict what information you choose to share in your public profile. Your de-identified data may be shared with other researchers and used in future projects.
		In some cases, we may be interested in re-contacting you for additional information or to participate in a follow-up experiment. If we do, your participation is completely optional and you would be compensated appropriately for your time. If you DO NOT wish to be recontacted, please check the box.
